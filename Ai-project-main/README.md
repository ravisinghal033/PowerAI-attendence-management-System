# Faical Recogning Attendance System 
<h3>AI-Powered Attendance Management System</h3><br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>
<p>This project presents an automated attendance system that leverages face recognition technology to streamline the process of marking student attendance. By employing machine learning algorithms, the system accurately identifies students in real-time using a college camera. Daily attendance reports are then sent to students via email, providing a transparent and efficient method for tracking attendance records.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Key Features</h3><br>
<li>Real-time face recognition: Accurate identification of students using advanced machine learning models.</li>
<li>Automated attendance marking: Seamlessly records student attendance without manual intervention.</li>
<li>Daily attendance reports: Delivers comprehensive attendance summaries directly to students' email addresses.</li>
<li>Scalability: Designed to handle large student populations and adapt to evolving requirements.</li>
<br><br>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3><br>
<li>Programming Language: Python</li>
<li>Libraries: OpenCV, dlib, face_recognition, NumPy, pandas</li>
<li>Machine Learning: Pre-trained face recognition models</li>
<li>Email Integration: smtplib, email.mime</li>
<li>Database: SQLite/MySQL (Choose one based on your implementation)</li>
<br>
<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
<li>For optimal performance, ensure that the camera is positioned in a well-lit area and that students' faces are clearly visible.</li>
<li>You may need to adjust the face recognition model's parameters or training data to improve accuracy for specific use cases.</li>
<li>Consider implementing additional features like attendance notifications, integration with a learning management system, or data analytics capabilities.</li>
